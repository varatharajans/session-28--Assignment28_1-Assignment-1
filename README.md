5. Problem Statement 1. You are expected to submit the steps you followed for doing all the below subtasks.
 • Use the “Sales_Data.xml” file.
 • Access the “xml” file in excel and save it to a comma delimited “csv” file
. • Make all the rows where “attractiveness<6” to  
• background color = red, font = 8, font type = italic. 
• Hide All the rows where “attractiveness<6” by using grouping. Hide in the sense, we should be able to see there is some rows there, which we can unfold to see. Also try hiding the data without grouping. 
 • Use the same data. The column named “attractiveness” is in general format. It is actually a rating from 1 to 10. Can you prepend “C” before the number. i.e. if it is 1, it should be converted to “C1”. Format the column to text type.
